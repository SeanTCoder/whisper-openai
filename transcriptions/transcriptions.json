    "text": " Well, good morning, brothers and sisters. I'm going to ask you to take your Bible, turn to John chapter 16. John chapter 16, and our study is going to be based there this morning. John chapter 16. I want to say it's so wonderful to be with you this morning, and I am looking forward to our time that we get to spend in the Word together. I like those songs that Ben led this morning, especially the one about how there is a balm in Gilead. We are here as brothers and sisters in Christ, as those who were previously sin-sick souls. We have found salvation. We have found healing, spiritual healing in Christ Jesus. If you're visiting with us, if you're new to this Christian thing, if you're lost in your walk with God, then we invite you to ask somebody who's sitting here this morning about how to find that healing that all of us have found who are in fellowship here. We're glad to help you with that. John 16, beginning in verse 32. Jesus, in the multiple chapters here, John 12 through 17, He is talking to His disciples. These are the last words that He's giving His disciples before He goes back to the Father, before He's arrested and crucified and laid in the grave. And what we have here in John 16 are the very last words that He speaks directly to His apostles. John 17 is a prayer He offers to God. But these are the final words He gives His apostles before He's arrested. He says this, Behold, an hour is coming and has already come for you to be scattered, each to his own home, and to leave Me alone. Yet I am not alone, because the Father is with Me. These things I have spoken to you, so that in Me you may have peace. In the world you have tribulation, but take courage. I have overcome the world. I love that passage because it tells us something very clearly, that Jesus wants His disciples, His followers, to live a life of peace. Now to be clear, when Jesus says that, He's not talking about some kind of external peace. He's not saying, look, I've spoken these things so that you can live a life where you never experience any conflict, and no trials or tribulations ever come into your life, and you never have any problems. And He's not saying either that I came so that you can have peace with other people. He even says, dearie's ministry, multiple times that His teaching, His gospel, is going to create some conflict, even among those who are close friends, even among those who are loved ones, even among families. There's going to be some conflict and some tension that's created by His teaching. And so do not think that when Jesus says, I've come and I've said these things to give you peace, that He's saying, you're not expected as a disciple to have any conflict in your life or any conflict in your relationship. That's not what He's talking about. Jesus did not come for the purpose of bringing peace between people. He came to bring peace between God and man. He came to give us a kind of peace that no one on earth can really give us. That's actually what He says in John 14 and verse 27. He says, Peace I leave with you. My peace I give to you. Not as the world gives do I give you. Do not let your heart be troubled, nor let it be fearful. Jesus says, I've come to give you a kind of peace that nobody in the world can give you. And that is peace between God and man. And that peace, that spiritual peace that Jesus accomplishes through His cross, that should also give Jesus' disciples a kind of inner peace. And I think that's what Jesus means here. It means also here in John 16, that Jesus wants His disciples to live their lives with an amazing sense of assurance, of joy, of tranquility, and calm. He wants you to have peace inside of your heart because you are sure that you are at peace with God. That's why Jesus says in John 14, 27, don't let your heart be troubled. And so I want to know this morning, when you look into your own life, does that characterize what's going on inside of you? Do you live with the kind of peace that Jesus promised to provide through His death on the cross? And I imagine that oftentimes, many times, what Jesus finds when He looks into the hearts of His disciples is it's not that kind of amazing peace, that joy and tranquility and calm. I think many times, if we're honest with ourselves, and maybe it's true of every single Christian at some point in their lives, that when Jesus looks at us, instead of finding the peace that we're supposed to have inside of our hearts, what He finds is just as much anxiety and stress and worry and fear and terror as He finds in all the worldly people that are surrounding us, sometimes we live without peace just like the lost people in the world. But Jesus, brothers and sisters, wants you and I to live in peace. He expects that we will live in peace. Again, remember that Jesus says, do not let your heart be troubled. Through His cross, He overcame the world and made it possible for us to have peace. do you live with that peace in your heart? Now in John 16, we find Jesus' apostles struggling to have that peace in themselves just like we struggle to have that peace in ourselves. And that's understandable because Jesus has told them this night that He's going to be leaving them. He's going to leave them. He's going to go somewhere else and they're not going to be able to come with Him. And in just a few minutes, He's going to be arrested and then eventually He's going to be brutally murdered. And that's going to cause all of them to scatter into the darkness of the night with fear and anxiety and trembling. And not only that, but after He is crucified on the cross and He is laid in that tomb, what we're going to find is we're going to find those apostles huddled together in fear and anxiety behind closed doors because of what happened on the cross. And yet what Jesus is telling them in John 16 is, when you look at what's about to happen, when you look at what's going to happen on the cross, it should not inspire stress and anxiety and fear because what I'm going to do on the cross is I'm going to overcome the world. I'm going to make it possible for you to have peace with God. And so when you look at the cross, you should look at that and think, in Jesus, I can have peace. And in this chapter, He talks about why that is. Why can we as Christians, as disciples, find peace in Jesus? Why can we look at the cross where He overcomes the world and despite everything that may be happening to us outside, all the trials and tribulations and difficulties that we go through, how can we live our lives with that calm, inner assurance and tranquility? This is what Jesus tells us. This is how we have peace in Him. I want you to consider, first of all, that we can find peace in the cross of Christ because His cross offers all of us hope for a better life to come. Throughout the course of His ministry, Jesus' apostles are not warm to the idea that He's going to be crucified. You know that, of course. They're not okay with the idea that He's going to leave the world. And that's because they've made up their minds that what Jesus is supposed to do, what the Messiah is supposed to do, is He's supposed to come into this world and set up a perfect earthly kingdom and establish His reign and everything from that point forward is supposed to be great here on this earth. And so, of course, in Matthew 16, when Jesus tells the apostles that He's going to leave this world, that He's going to be arrested and crucified, Peter famously rebukes Him. It says this in 16 and verse 21, from that time, Jesus began to show His disciples that He must go to Jerusalem and suffer many things from the elders and chief priests and scribes and be killed and be raised up the third day. Peter took Him aside and began to rebuke Him saying, God forbid it, Lord. This shall never happen to you. But He turned and said to Peter, Get behind me, Satan. You are a stumbling block to me, for you are not setting your mind on God's interests but on man's. When Peter hears this idea that the Messiah is going to leave this world, that He's going to be killed and He's not going to set up that perfect earthly kingdom they're waiting for, He says, God forbid it. This isn't going to happen. This isn't what I want. This isn't what I think is right. And of course, in John 16, earlier in this chapter, all the apostles react negatively to the idea that Jesus is leaving. John 16, verse 5, but now, this is Jesus talking, but now I am going to Him who sent me and none of you ask me where are you going but because I have said these things to you, sorrow has filled your heart. In their mind, the promise of the Messiah was that He was going to fix this broken world. The Messiah was finally going to change the way things worked here. And so to them, Jesus leaving the world and leaving things the way they were, that's a failure. To them, Jesus dying on the cross, that's a total defeat. He's supposed to set up His kingdom and reign. We see that in Luke 24. Remember that conversation on the road to Emmaus? Those disciples told Jesus, but we were hoping, talking about Jesus dying, we were hoping that it was He who was going to redeem Israel and decide, indeed, beside all of this, it is the third day since all these things have happened. And so as they were walking that road to Emmaus, those disciples were despondent because they thought Jesus was going to fix everything and it turns out He died instead. That's what they thought. Their Messiah was supposed to make this world better. And here in John 16, Jesus is going to encourage His disciples to see things differently, to look at His ministry differently, and to see His cross in a different kind of way. To look at His cross and to not see defeat and not see failure, but to see it as the fulfillment of what God actually promises to His disciples. John 16 and verse 16, this is what Jesus tells them. He says, A little while and you will no longer see Me. And again, a little while and you will see Me. Some of His disciples then said to one another, What is this thing He is telling us? A little while and you will not see Me. And again, a little while and you will see Me. And because I go to the Father. So they were saying, What is this that He says? A little while. We do not know what He's talking about. Which was common for them. Jesus knew that they wished to question Him. And He said to them, Are you deliberating together about this that I said? A little while and you will not see Me. And again, a little while and you will see Me. Truly I say to you that you will weep and lament but the world will rejoice. You will grieve but your grief will be turned into joy. Whenever a woman is in labor she has pain because her hour has come. But when she gives birth to the child she no longer remembers the anguish because of the joy that a child has been born into the world. Therefore you too have grief now but I will see you again and your heart will rejoice and no one will take your joy away from you. Now that text can get a little wordy and a little confusing with all the words that Jesus uses but basically what He's saying is first of all He says a little while and you will not see Me. And when He says that He's talking about His execution. He says look in a little while they're going to take Me they're going to arrest Me they're going to kill Me they're going to put Me in a tomb and you're not going to see Me anymore. And when that happens you're going to weep and the world's going to rejoice because they're going to think that they won. But that won't be the end of the story. Because again in just a little while after I'm laid in that tomb you're going to see Me again. And in that day in that day you're going to rejoice you're going to be full of joy and in that day the kind of joy that you have in your heart is the kind of joy that no one will be able to take away from you. And why is that? When they see that resurrected Jesus why are they going to feel that joy and that peace that no one can take away? It's not because He's going to go on and He's going to fix the broken world like they thought. The world is going to stay just as ugly and broken as it was before He rose from the dead. No, they're going to be filled with peace and joy because when they see the resurrected Jesus they're going to understand what the promise really is. His promise is not to fix this broken world instead of His earthly kingdom. His promise is that I'm going to give you eternal life. That when your life is over I'm promising you a better, amazing life a communion with God in the life to come. This is the promise to which we hold. We read about it in Colossians 3 in verse 1 Therefore if you have been raised up with Christ keep seeking the things that are above where Christ is seated at the right hand of God set your mind on the things above not on the things that are on the earth for you have died and your life is hidden with Christ and God. And when Christ who is our life is revealed then you also will be revealed with Him in glory. And that's why when they see the resurrected Jesus they have that joy and that peace that this world cannot take away. Because when they see the resurrected Jesus they understand that what He's promised them is not to fix this broken world but to give them an eternal life in the life to come. And I think brothers and sisters we have to say this I think one of the things that really keeps us from living in peace from having that calm assurance in our heart from living our lives with tranquility and joy is that like Jesus' disciples here this night before He's betrayed sometimes we hold on to the wrong promise. those disciples thought that the Messiah was supposed to come and fix this world and make everything the way it was supposed to be here and now. And sometimes that's what we think Jesus is supposed to do in our lives. We think He's supposed to make our lives here perfect. We think He's supposed to make this world better than it is. We think that what Jesus is going to do is He's going to change this world and make things different than the way that they are. And we need to remember that when we think that way we're doing exactly what Peter does and the rest of the apostles do. We're setting our hope on the wrong promise. We're setting our mind on man's interest and not on God's. We need to set our minds on what our hope truly is which in 1 Peter 1 and verse 13 Jesus says this therefore prepare your minds for action keep sober in spirit fix your hope completely on the grace to be brought to you at the revelation of Jesus Christ. understand brothers and sisters that the message of Jesus on the cross is not that Jesus is going to change this world and make it better than it should be. The message on the cross is not that He's going to one day bring heaven to earth. The message of the cross is that Jesus died there so that He could reconcile mankind to God and that through His blood we can be saved and we can have the hope of resurrection and eternal life. Jesus promised not to save the world but to save us from the world. That's the promise we need to hang on to. And I think if we look into our hearts and we look at the anxiety and the stress and the worry that we feel I think a lot of times what we'll find is that comes that comes from us hanging on to the wrong promise. We're hoping that He makes things better here instead of fixing our hope on the life that He really promised us when He returns. We need to hang on to what our hope truly is. That through the cross Jesus offers hope for a better life to come. And I'll tell you one thing we need to appreciate. That the apostles they sure did that themselves. You know sometimes what we like to do is we like to rag on the apostles and we like to mock them. I guess I've already done that this morning haven't I? We like to joke about their lack of understanding or their lack of belief and we think to ourselves that they should have done better. They should have understood these things. We make fun of them. How could they not understand Jesus when He said these things over and over and over and over and over again? How could they still be looking for an earthly kingdom when Jesus made it so clear that He's going to give them an eternal life and that's what they should look forward to? But what we don't appreciate is that when we look in the gospels all of their lack of faith and all of their doubt and all of their lack of understanding all of that is chronicled before the cross and before the resurrection. And sometimes what we do is we commiserate with them. As we look at them and we say well they were filled with doubt and they were filled with anxiety and they were filled with fear and we look at ourselves and say you know sometimes I'm like them. I'm fearful like they were. I doubt like they did. And so it's kind of understandable that I live my life the way I do without having that peace because they live that way too and yet we forget that all of that doubt and anxiety and fear that we read about happened before the cross and before the resurrection. Because once those apostles see a resurrected Jesus everything changes for them forever. When they see that resurrected Jesus it filled them with joy and assurance and endurance and peace it gave them something that this world never took away from them. And you can see that if you'll go with me I don't have this on the screen go with me real quick real quick to Acts chapter 4. Acts chapter 4 we see before the cross and before the resurrection all of this fear and all of this anxiety and all of this confusion but what we see on the other side of the resurrection once they've seen the resurrected Messiah is something completely different from these men. Acts chapter 4 Acts chapter 4 in verse 8 the Bible says this then Peter filled with the Holy Spirit said to them by the way them are the people who just murdered Jesus a little while before if we are on trial today for a benefit done to a sick man as to how this man has been made well let it be known to all of you and to all the people of Israel that by the name of Jesus Christ the Nazarene whom you crucified whom God raised from the dead by this name this man stands before you in good health. He is the stone which was rejected by you the builders and which became the chief cornerstone and there is salvation in no one else for there is no other name under heaven that has been given among men by which we must be saved and notice what it says in verse 13 now as they observed the confidence of Peter and John and that is what you see in the apostles throughout the rest of the Bible story that after they see the resurrected Jesus they live with boldness and confidence and joy and peace and tranquility even when the most terrible things that men can do to them are happening it doesn't touch their joy and their peace because they're not thinking that Jesus is going to make this world better they're hanging on to the promise of a better life to come I'll tell you brothers and sisters the resurrection was enough for them knowing that Jesus rose from the dead rose to life again had overcome the world and had promised them eternal life that was enough to drive away all of that anxiety and stress and fear that had dominated them before and I want to know is it enough for you this morning can you look at the cross of Christ and how he overcame the world and can you say to yourself that in him I'm going to have peace because I am going to hang on to that hope of eternal life that he's given me Jesus wants you to live in peace and he makes that possible through his cross I want you to consider this as well that not only not only does Jesus give us peace by offering us the hope of a better life but he also gives us peace because through his cross he became our mediator in this world there is nothing that should bring us more peace and calm to our hearts than the idea that Jesus offers us eternal life but the truth is sometimes it's hard to focus on that and sometimes it's hard to lean on that because at the end of the day we still do have to live in this broken in this run down world where things aren't the way that it should seem and that's why it's so important for us to recognize this second thing that through the cross Jesus does become our mediator as we live in this world we are going to have trials and tribulations we're going to have deep heartaches and deep sorrows and not only that but Jesus promises in fact he promises in these chapters John 12 through 17 that we are going to have persecutions and afflictions for those who are truly disciples of Jesus we can expect there is a certainty of persecution in John 15 look at this really quickly one chapter back John 15 and verse 18 remember what Jesus says here if the world hates you you know that it hated me before it hated you if you were of the world the world would love its own but because you are not of the world but I chose you out of the world because of this the world hates you remember the word that I said to you a slave is not greater than his master if they persecuted me they will also persecute you if they kept my word they will keep yours also he'll also tell them at the beginning of John chapter 16 there is going to come a time where people are going to persecute them and treat them badly and put them to death because they will think when they are doing it that they are offering service to God this is the world that we live in and that is why it is so important for us to recognize and appreciate that not only has Jesus promised to give us life eternal life when this world is over but he has also promised that he now that he has died on the cross has become the mediator between God and man that through him we have access to God while we live here on this earth this is something Jesus told them earlier in John 14 verse 12 truly truly I say to you he who believes in me the works that I do he will do also in greater works than these he will do because I go to the father whatever you ask in my name that I will do so that the father may be glorified in the son if you ask anything in my name I will do it and so Jesus says as you live here in this world and as you endure trials and tribulations I want you to remember that when you ask God for things in my name when you ask God for things according to his will he hears you because I am the mediator between God and man he'll also say this in John 16 John 16 verse 23 he says this here in that day you will not question me about anything truly truly I say to you if you ask the father for anything in my name he will give it to you until now you have asked for nothing in my name ask and you will receive so that your joy may be full these things I have spoken to you in figurative language an hour is coming when I will no longer speak to you in figurative language but I will tell you plainly of the father in that day you will ask in my name and I do not say to you that I will request of the father on your behalf for the father himself loves you because you have loved me and I believe that I came forth from the father and so he tells them look I'm going to leave this world but I want you to remember that when I leave this world I'm going to the father and because of what I'm going to do on the cross I become the mediator now what you can do is you can pray to the father in my name and he will hear you and you will receive the things that you ask for when they are according to his will because of Jesus we can reach out to God here on this earth and he will hear us and that that is supposed to that is meant to bring us the most incredible kind of peace it's a peace that Jesus himself would feel as he says remember in verse 32 behold an hour is coming and has already come for you to be scattered each to his home and to leave me alone and yet I am not alone because the father is with me Jesus says look there's going to come a time this very night when you're all going to leave you're all going to betray me you're all going to run away off into the darkness and leave me alone and in that moment I know I know that even though none of you are with me I'm not alone because I've got God on my side and Jesus feels peace in that and we ought to feel peace in that as well because the same thing is true for us that even when everything seems to turn sideways in our lives and even when everyone seems to betray us in this life we know as children of God that God is with us still why do we struggle and wrestle with the lack of peace and tranquility in our hearts so often and I think a big reason is because we don't appreciate how special it is that Jesus is our mediator we don't appreciate how wonderful it is and what an advantage it is to be able to reach out to God through Christ and ask him for what we need while we live here on this earth you know so often I think it's true that we don't take advantage of that access we don't take advantage of that privilege that we have we don't lean on it we don't truly lean on God and that's what we need to develop in our lives we need to develop a turn to God reflex where it becomes our habit our instinct our practice that whenever I face a trial whenever I face a tribulation I turn to him I look to him what we need to do in our lives is stop turning toward other things because that's what we often do isn't it when bad things happen is that the first thing we do do we think to ourselves because Jesus died on the cross I have a mediator with God and I can reach out to God through Jesus and I can have access to the most powerful being in the universe who promised not only that he'll hear us but that he loves us what do we turn to instead? Distractions I pull out my phone turn on the TV play music on the radio so I don't have to think about what I'm dealing with we turn towards sin we engage in those addictive behaviors because they make us feel better and they kind of ease the pain and the tension that we feel a little bit we turn toward other people we reach out to all the people in our life we tell them all the bad things that are happening to us and we talk to them about everything we ask for their advice we ask for their help we ask what they can do for us and then by the time we get to the end of that if we still have a voice left so that our voice isn't cracking then finally we bow on our knees and we pray to God stop turning towards other things when you face trials turn toward him that's the thing that's supposed to bring us peace that we can turn to him when we need him and he will hear us because of what Jesus did on the cross and I'll have to say this as well that sometimes the reason why we don't do that is because we don't trust that it will really work we doubt that when we turn to God he really will hear us and care for us and move for us but he will as Paul says in Ephesians 3 when we turn to God in our times of distress he can do exceedingly abundantly beyond all that we ask or think understand brothers and sisters that Jesus he wants you to have peace he expects his disciples to live a life of peace and that doesn't mean that he promises to give you a perfect life free from trials and trouble but what he does promise is he promises to give you this untouchable kind of joy that trials and tribulations in this world cannot ruin or affect he promises to give us a hope of eternal life when this life is over and he promises that as we live here in this broken world we have access to God through him and we can access the strength of God even while we remain here to help us get through the difficult things we face remember what Jesus says that in me you may have peace John 16 33 these things I have spoken to you so that in me you may have peace in the world you have tribulation but take courage take courage I have overcome the world Jesus wants you to live in peace do you and do you understand that this peace that he offers is only offered to those who have obeyed the gospel this peace is only offered to his disciples and those who have been saved by the blood of the lamb the bible says that if we want to be saved there is a simple response to that Jesus accomplished the hard work on the cross he offered the sacrifice the perfect sacrifice that offers cleansing for sin that we could never offer and what's required of us to be at peace with God is that we believe that Jesus Christ is the son of God we repent of our sins we confess our faith in him before men and we are baptized in water to have those sins washed away if we can help you do that or help you with anything else we invite you to come to the front while we stand and while we sing",

      "text": " Well, good morning, brothers and sisters. I'm going to ask you to take your Bible, turn to John chapter 16. John chapter 16, and our study is going to be based there this morning. John chapter 16. I want to say it's so wonderful to be with you this morning, and I am looking forward to our time that we get to spend in the Word together. I like those songs that Ben led this morning, especially the one about how there is a balm in Gilead. We are here as brothers and sisters in Christ, as those who were previously sin-sick souls. We have found salvation. We have found healing, spiritual healing in Christ Jesus. If you're visiting with us, if you're new to this Christian thing, if you're lost in your walk with God, then we invite you to ask somebody who's sitting here this morning about how to find that healing that all of us have found who are in fellowship here. We're glad to help you with that. John 16, beginning in verse 32. Jesus, in the multiple chapters here, John 12 through 17, He is talking to His disciples. These are the last words that He's giving His disciples before He goes back to the Father, before He's arrested and crucified and laid in the grave. And what we have here in John 16 are the very last words that He speaks directly to His apostles. John 17 is a prayer He offers to God. But these are the final words He gives His apostles before He's arrested. He says this, Behold, an hour is coming and has already come for you to be scattered, each to his own home, and to leave Me alone. Yet I am not alone, because the Father is with Me. These things I have spoken to you, so that in Me you may have peace. In the world you have tribulation, but take courage. I have overcome the world. I love that passage because it tells us something very clearly, that Jesus wants His disciples, His followers, to live a life of peace. Now to be clear, when Jesus says that, He's not talking about some kind of external peace. He's not saying, look, I've spoken these things so that you can live a life where you never experience any conflict, and no trials or tribulations ever come into your life, and you never have any problems. And He's not saying either that I came so that you can have peace with other people. He even says, dearie's ministry, multiple times that His teaching, His gospel, is going to create some conflict, even among those who are close friends, even among those who are loved ones, even among families. There's going to be some conflict and some tension that's created by His teaching. And so do not think that when Jesus says, I've come and I've said these things to give you peace, that He's saying, you're not expected as a disciple to have any conflict in your life or any conflict in your relationship. That's not what He's talking about. Jesus did not come for the purpose of bringing peace between people. He came to bring peace between God and man. He came to give us a kind of peace that no one on earth can really give us. That's actually what He says in John 14 and verse 27. He says, Peace I leave with you. My peace I give to you. Not as the world gives do I give you. Do not let your heart be troubled, nor let it be fearful. Jesus says, I've come to give you a kind of peace that nobody in the world can give you. And that is peace between God and man. And that peace, that spiritual peace that Jesus accomplishes through His cross, that should also give Jesus' disciples a kind of inner peace. And I think that's what Jesus means here. It means also here in John 16, that Jesus wants His disciples to live their lives with an amazing sense of assurance, of joy, of tranquility, and calm. He wants you to have peace inside of your heart because you are sure that you are at peace with God. That's why Jesus says in John 14, 27, don't let your heart be troubled. And so I want to know this morning, when you look into your own life, does that characterize what's going on inside of you? Do you live with the kind of peace that Jesus promised to provide through His death on the cross? And I imagine that oftentimes, many times, what Jesus finds when He looks into the hearts of His disciples is it's not that kind of amazing peace, that joy and tranquility and calm. I think many times, if we're honest with ourselves, and maybe it's true of every single Christian at some point in their lives, that when Jesus looks at us, instead of finding the peace that we're supposed to have inside of our hearts, what He finds is just as much anxiety and stress and worry and fear and terror as He finds in all the worldly people that are surrounding us, sometimes we live without peace just like the lost people in the world. But Jesus, brothers and sisters, wants you and I to live in peace. He expects that we will live in peace. Again, remember that Jesus says, do not let your heart be troubled. Through His cross, He overcame the world and made it possible for us to have peace. do you live with that peace in your heart? Now in John 16, we find Jesus' apostles struggling to have that peace in themselves just like we struggle to have that peace in ourselves. And that's understandable because Jesus has told them this night that He's going to be leaving them. He's going to leave them. He's going to go somewhere else and they're not going to be able to come with Him. And in just a few minutes, He's going to be arrested and then eventually He's going to be brutally murdered. And that's going to cause all of them to scatter into the darkness of the night with fear and anxiety and trembling. And not only that, but after He is crucified on the cross and He is laid in that tomb, what we're going to find is we're going to find those apostles huddled together in fear and anxiety behind closed doors because of what happened on the cross. And yet what Jesus is telling them in John 16 is, when you look at what's about to happen, when you look at what's going to happen on the cross, it should not inspire stress and anxiety and fear because what I'm going to do on the cross is I'm going to overcome the world. I'm going to make it possible for you to have peace with God. And so when you look at the cross, you should look at that and think, in Jesus, I can have peace. And in this chapter, He talks about why that is. Why can we as Christians, as disciples, find peace in Jesus? Why can we look at the cross where He overcomes the world and despite everything that may be happening to us outside, all the trials and tribulations and difficulties that we go through, how can we live our lives with that calm, inner assurance and tranquility? This is what Jesus tells us. This is how we have peace in Him. I want you to consider, first of all, that we can find peace in the cross of Christ because His cross offers all of us hope for a better life to come. Throughout the course of His ministry, Jesus' apostles are not warm to the idea that He's going to be crucified. You know that, of course. They're not okay with the idea that He's going to leave the world. And that's because they've made up their minds that what Jesus is supposed to do, what the Messiah is supposed to do, is He's supposed to come into this world and set up a perfect earthly kingdom and establish His reign and everything from that point forward is supposed to be great here on this earth. And so, of course, in Matthew 16, when Jesus tells the apostles that He's going to leave this world, that He's going to be arrested and crucified, Peter famously rebukes Him. It says this in 16 and verse 21, from that time, Jesus began to show His disciples that He must go to Jerusalem and suffer many things from the elders and chief priests and scribes and be killed and be raised up the third day. Peter took Him aside and began to rebuke Him saying, God forbid it, Lord. This shall never happen to you. But He turned and said to Peter, Get behind me, Satan. You are a stumbling block to me, for you are not setting your mind on God's interests but on man's. When Peter hears this idea that the Messiah is going to leave this world, that He's going to be killed and He's not going to set up that perfect earthly kingdom they're waiting for, He says, God forbid it. This isn't going to happen. This isn't what I want. This isn't what I think is right. And of course, in John 16, earlier in this chapter, all the apostles react negatively to the idea that Jesus is leaving. John 16, verse 5, but now, this is Jesus talking, but now I am going to Him who sent me and none of you ask me where are you going but because I have said these things to you, sorrow has filled your heart. In their mind, the promise of the Messiah was that He was going to fix this broken world. The Messiah was finally going to change the way things worked here. And so to them, Jesus leaving the world and leaving things the way they were, that's a failure. To them, Jesus dying on the cross, that's a total defeat. He's supposed to set up His kingdom and reign. We see that in Luke 24. Remember that conversation on the road to Emmaus? Those disciples told Jesus, but we were hoping, talking about Jesus dying, we were hoping that it was He who was going to redeem Israel and decide, indeed, beside all of this, it is the third day since all these things have happened. And so as they were walking that road to Emmaus, those disciples were despondent because they thought Jesus was going to fix everything and it turns out He died instead. That's what they thought. Their Messiah was supposed to make this world better. And here in John 16, Jesus is going to encourage His disciples to see things differently, to look at His ministry differently, and to see His cross in a different kind of way. To look at His cross and to not see defeat and not see failure, but to see it as the fulfillment of what God actually promises to His disciples. John 16 and verse 16, this is what Jesus tells them. He says, A little while and you will no longer see Me. And again, a little while and you will see Me. Some of His disciples then said to one another, What is this thing He is telling us? A little while and you will not see Me. And again, a little while and you will see Me. And because I go to the Father. So they were saying, What is this that He says? A little while. We do not know what He's talking about. Which was common for them. Jesus knew that they wished to question Him. And He said to them, Are you deliberating together about this that I said? A little while and you will not see Me. And again, a little while and you will see Me. Truly I say to you that you will weep and lament but the world will rejoice. You will grieve but your grief will be turned into joy. Whenever a woman is in labor she has pain because her hour has come. But when she gives birth to the child she no longer remembers the anguish because of the joy that a child has been born into the world. Therefore you too have grief now but I will see you again and your heart will rejoice and no one will take your joy away from you. Now that text can get a little wordy and a little confusing with all the words that Jesus uses but basically what He's saying is first of all He says a little while and you will not see Me. And when He says that He's talking about His execution. He says look in a little while they're going to take Me they're going to arrest Me they're going to kill Me they're going to put Me in a tomb and you're not going to see Me anymore. And when that happens you're going to weep and the world's going to rejoice because they're going to think that they won. But that won't be the end of the story. Because again in just a little while after I'm laid in that tomb you're going to see Me again. And in that day in that day you're going to rejoice you're going to be full of joy and in that day the kind of joy that you have in your heart is the kind of joy that no one will be able to take away from you. And why is that? When they see that resurrected Jesus why are they going to feel that joy and that peace that no one can take away? It's not because He's going to go on and He's going to fix the broken world like they thought. The world is going to stay just as ugly and broken as it was before He rose from the dead. No, they're going to be filled with peace and joy because when they see the resurrected Jesus they're going to understand what the promise really is. His promise is not to fix this broken world instead of His earthly kingdom. His promise is that I'm going to give you eternal life. That when your life is over I'm promising you a better, amazing life a communion with God in the life to come. This is the promise to which we hold. We read about it in Colossians 3 in verse 1 Therefore if you have been raised up with Christ keep seeking the things that are above where Christ is seated at the right hand of God set your mind on the things above not on the things that are on the earth for you have died and your life is hidden with Christ and God. And when Christ who is our life is revealed then you also will be revealed with Him in glory. And that's why when they see the resurrected Jesus they have that joy and that peace that this world cannot take away. Because when they see the resurrected Jesus they understand that what He's promised them is not to fix this broken world but to give them an eternal life in the life to come. And I think brothers and sisters we have to say this I think one of the things that really keeps us from living in peace from having that calm assurance in our heart from living our lives with tranquility and joy is that like Jesus' disciples here this night before He's betrayed sometimes we hold on to the wrong promise. those disciples thought that the Messiah was supposed to come and fix this world and make everything the way it was supposed to be here and now. And sometimes that's what we think Jesus is supposed to do in our lives. We think He's supposed to make our lives here perfect. We think He's supposed to make this world better than it is. We think that what Jesus is going to do is He's going to change this world and make things different than the way that they are. And we need to remember that when we think that way we're doing exactly what Peter does and the rest of the apostles do. We're setting our hope on the wrong promise. We're setting our mind on man's interest and not on God's. We need to set our minds on what our hope truly is which in 1 Peter 1 and verse 13 Jesus says this therefore prepare your minds for action keep sober in spirit fix your hope completely on the grace to be brought to you at the revelation of Jesus Christ. understand brothers and sisters that the message of Jesus on the cross is not that Jesus is going to change this world and make it better than it should be. The message on the cross is not that He's going to one day bring heaven to earth. The message of the cross is that Jesus died there so that He could reconcile mankind to God and that through His blood we can be saved and we can have the hope of resurrection and eternal life. Jesus promised not to save the world but to save us from the world. That's the promise we need to hang on to. And I think if we look into our hearts and we look at the anxiety and the stress and the worry that we feel I think a lot of times what we'll find is that comes that comes from us hanging on to the wrong promise. We're hoping that He makes things better here instead of fixing our hope on the life that He really promised us when He returns. We need to hang on to what our hope truly is. That through the cross Jesus offers hope for a better life to come. And I'll tell you one thing we need to appreciate. That the apostles they sure did that themselves. You know sometimes what we like to do is we like to rag on the apostles and we like to mock them. I guess I've already done that this morning haven't I? We like to joke about their lack of understanding or their lack of belief and we think to ourselves that they should have done better. They should have understood these things. We make fun of them. How could they not understand Jesus when He said these things over and over and over and over and over again? How could they still be looking for an earthly kingdom when Jesus made it so clear that He's going to give them an eternal life and that's what they should look forward to? But what we don't appreciate is that when we look in the gospels all of their lack of faith and all of their doubt and all of their lack of understanding all of that is chronicled before the cross and before the resurrection. And sometimes what we do is we commiserate with them. As we look at them and we say well they were filled with doubt and they were filled with anxiety and they were filled with fear and we look at ourselves and say you know sometimes I'm like them. I'm fearful like they were. I doubt like they did. And so it's kind of understandable that I live my life the way I do without having that peace because they live that way too and yet we forget that all of that doubt and anxiety and fear that we read about happened before the cross and before the resurrection. Because once those apostles see a resurrected Jesus everything changes for them forever. When they see that resurrected Jesus it filled them with joy and assurance and endurance and peace it gave them something that this world never took away from them. And you can see that if you'll go with me I don't have this on the screen go with me real quick real quick to Acts chapter 4. Acts chapter 4 we see before the cross and before the resurrection all of this fear and all of this anxiety and all of this confusion but what we see on the other side of the resurrection once they've seen the resurrected Messiah is something completely different from these men. Acts chapter 4 Acts chapter 4 in verse 8 the Bible says this then Peter filled with the Holy Spirit said to them by the way them are the people who just murdered Jesus a little while before if we are on trial today for a benefit done to a sick man as to how this man has been made well let it be known to all of you and to all the people of Israel that by the name of Jesus Christ the Nazarene whom you crucified whom God raised from the dead by this name this man stands before you in good health. He is the stone which was rejected by you the builders and which became the chief cornerstone and there is salvation in no one else for there is no other name under heaven that has been given among men by which we must be saved and notice what it says in verse 13 now as they observed the confidence of Peter and John and that is what you see in the apostles throughout the rest of the Bible story that after they see the resurrected Jesus they live with boldness and confidence and joy and peace and tranquility even when the most terrible things that men can do to them are happening it doesn't touch their joy and their peace because they're not thinking that Jesus is going to make this world better they're hanging on to the promise of a better life to come I'll tell you brothers and sisters the resurrection was enough for them knowing that Jesus rose from the dead rose to life again had overcome the world and had promised them eternal life that was enough to drive away all of that anxiety and stress and fear that had dominated them before and I want to know is it enough for you this morning can you look at the cross of Christ and how he overcame the world and can you say to yourself that in him I'm going to have peace because I am going to hang on to that hope of eternal life that he's given me Jesus wants you to live in peace and he makes that possible through his cross I want you to consider this as well that not only not only does Jesus give us peace by offering us the hope of a better life but he also gives us peace because through his cross he became our mediator in this world there is nothing that should bring us more peace and calm to our hearts than the idea that Jesus offers us eternal life but the truth is sometimes it's hard to focus on that and sometimes it's hard to lean on that because at the end of the day we still do have to live in this broken in this run down world where things aren't the way that it should seem and that's why it's so important for us to recognize this second thing that through the cross Jesus does become our mediator as we live in this world we are going to have trials and tribulations we're going to have deep heartaches and deep sorrows and not only that but Jesus promises in fact he promises in these chapters John 12 through 17 that we are going to have persecutions and afflictions for those who are truly disciples of Jesus we can expect there is a certainty of persecution in John 15 look at this really quickly one chapter back John 15 and verse 18 remember what Jesus says here if the world hates you you know that it hated me before it hated you if you were of the world the world would love its own but because you are not of the world but I chose you out of the world because of this the world hates you remember the word that I said to you a slave is not greater than his master if they persecuted me they will also persecute you if they kept my word they will keep yours also he'll also tell them at the beginning of John chapter 16 there is going to come a time where people are going to persecute them and treat them badly and put them to death because they will think when they are doing it that they are offering service to God this is the world that we live in and that is why it is so important for us to recognize and appreciate that not only has Jesus promised to give us life eternal life when this world is over but he has also promised that he now that he has died on the cross has become the mediator between God and man that through him we have access to God while we live here on this earth this is something Jesus told them earlier in John 14 verse 12 truly truly I say to you he who believes in me the works that I do he will do also in greater works than these he will do because I go to the father whatever you ask in my name that I will do so that the father may be glorified in the son if you ask anything in my name I will do it and so Jesus says as you live here in this world and as you endure trials and tribulations I want you to remember that when you ask God for things in my name when you ask God for things according to his will he hears you because I am the mediator between God and man he'll also say this in John 16 John 16 verse 23 he says this here in that day you will not question me about anything truly truly I say to you if you ask the father for anything in my name he will give it to you until now you have asked for nothing in my name ask and you will receive so that your joy may be full these things I have spoken to you in figurative language an hour is coming when I will no longer speak to you in figurative language but I will tell you plainly of the father in that day you will ask in my name and I do not say to you that I will request of the father on your behalf for the father himself loves you because you have loved me and I believe that I came forth from the father and so he tells them look I'm going to leave this world but I want you to remember that when I leave this world I'm going to the father and because of what I'm going to do on the cross I become the mediator now what you can do is you can pray to the father in my name and he will hear you and you will receive the things that you ask for when they are according to his will because of Jesus we can reach out to God here on this earth and he will hear us and that that is supposed to that is meant to bring us the most incredible kind of peace it's a peace that Jesus himself would feel as he says remember in verse 32 behold an hour is coming and has already come for you to be scattered each to his home and to leave me alone and yet I am not alone because the father is with me Jesus says look there's going to come a time this very night when you're all going to leave you're all going to betray me you're all going to run away off into the darkness and leave me alone and in that moment I know I know that even though none of you are with me I'm not alone because I've got God on my side and Jesus feels peace in that and we ought to feel peace in that as well because the same thing is true for us that even when everything seems to turn sideways in our lives and even when everyone seems to betray us in this life we know as children of God that God is with us still why do we struggle and wrestle with the lack of peace and tranquility in our hearts so often and I think a big reason is because we don't appreciate how special it is that Jesus is our mediator we don't appreciate how wonderful it is and what an advantage it is to be able to reach out to God through Christ and ask him for what we need while we live here on this earth you know so often I think it's true that we don't take advantage of that access we don't take advantage of that privilege that we have we don't lean on it we don't truly lean on God and that's what we need to develop in our lives we need to develop a turn to God reflex where it becomes our habit our instinct our practice that whenever I face a trial whenever I face a tribulation I turn to him I look to him what we need to do in our lives is stop turning toward other things because that's what we often do isn't it when bad things happen is that the first thing we do do we think to ourselves because Jesus died on the cross I have a mediator with God and I can reach out to God through Jesus and I can have access to the most powerful being in the universe who promised not only that he'll hear us but that he loves us what do we turn to instead? Distractions I pull out my phone turn on the TV play music on the radio so I don't have to think about what I'm dealing with we turn towards sin we engage in those addictive behaviors because they make us feel better and they kind of ease the pain and the tension that we feel a little bit we turn toward other people we reach out to all the people in our life we tell them all the bad things that are happening to us and we talk to them about everything we ask for their advice we ask for their help we ask what they can do for us and then by the time we get to the end of that if we still have a voice left so that our voice isn't cracking then finally we bow on our knees and we pray to God stop turning towards other things when you face trials turn toward him that's the thing that's supposed to bring us peace that we can turn to him when we need him and he will hear us because of what Jesus did on the cross and I'll have to say this as well that sometimes the reason why we don't do that is because we don't trust that it will really work we doubt that when we turn to God he really will hear us and care for us and move for us but he will as Paul says in Ephesians 3 when we turn to God in our times of distress he can do exceedingly abundantly beyond all that we ask or think understand brothers and sisters that Jesus he wants you to have peace he expects his disciples to live a life of peace and that doesn't mean that he promises to give you a perfect life free from trials and trouble but what he does promise is he promises to give you this untouchable kind of joy that trials and tribulations in this world cannot ruin or affect he promises to give us a hope of eternal life when this life is over and he promises that as we live here in this broken world we have access to God through him and we can access the strength of God even while we remain here to help us get through the difficult things we face remember what Jesus says that in me you may have peace John 16 33 these things I have spoken to you so that in me you may have peace in the world you have tribulation but take courage take courage I have overcome the world Jesus wants you to live in peace do you and do you understand that this peace that he offers is only offered to those who have obeyed the gospel this peace is only offered to his disciples and those who have been saved by the blood of the lamb the bible says that if we want to be saved there is a simple response to that Jesus accomplished the hard work on the cross he offered the sacrifice the perfect sacrifice that offers cleansing for sin that we could never offer and what's required of us to be at peace with God is that we believe that Jesus Christ is the son of God we repent of our sins we confess our faith in him before men and we are baptized in water to have those sins washed away if we can help you do that or help you with anything else we invite you to come to the front while we stand and while we sing",
